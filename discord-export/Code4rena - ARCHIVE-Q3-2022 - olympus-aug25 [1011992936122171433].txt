Olympus V3, aka codename Bophades, is finally going into Code Arena audit this week. The framework we are building is meant to make a very strong foundation for Olympus moving forward.

Good timing on this, I was just getting comfortable with Olympus after hunting on Immunefi


[08/26/2022 11:07 AM] elku.cryptos
so i ran the following commands in WSL ubuntu,
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
forge build
FORGE_GAS_REPORT=true forge test
```
and most of the tests passed except few errors. any idea?

foundryup?


[08/26/2022 11:11 AM] elku.cryptos
does it work for you? its always a full reinstall for me. as it will say to remove forge, cast and anvil first. 
not sure if its because i am using windows.


[08/26/2022 11:13 AM] ind.igo
Ah try forge test --ffi


[08/26/2022 11:14 AM] ind.igo
Could be an issue in the config, the ffi flag should not be necessary


[08/26/2022 11:16 AM] illilli000
the following works for me, but I'm not on windows:
> rm -Rf 2022-08-olympus || true && git clone https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus.git && cd 2022-08-olympus && git submodule update --init --recursive && foundryup && forge build && FORGE_GAS_REPORT=true forge test

thank you! the intention of the architecture is to be extendible by governance. meaning anyone can add new modules to the system in the future. so it should be extremely easy to audit.


[08/26/2022 4:41 PM] oighty
Are you still having this issue? It may be a shell permission issue with some of the .sh scripts we use for a test fixture.

```C44 - Use unchecked blocks where overflow/underflow is impossible, or where an overflow/underflow is unrealistic on human timescales (counters, etc). Comment explanations wherever unchecked is used, along with an estimate of how much gas it saves (if relevant).```

[08/28/2022 3:08 PM] ind.igo
this is only necessary as a transition since a lot of the dao multisigs still control a few params. the goal with this new code is to transition over to more automated systems. the intention of the governor is to install policy contracts which do some actions, rather than how compound-like governors do arbitrary actions


[08/28/2022 3:09 PM] ind.igo
the policies that have been created so far are still controlled by multisigs, as the current systems are. we intend to install a new governor policy that will be able to do the multisig's job. but that will be a later iteration

How do you navigate the code? I have `juanblanco.solidity` and `tintinweb.solidity-visual-auditor`, but vscode still doesnt find many contracts and functions. For instance here https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-olympus/blob/main/src/policies/Heart.sol/#L21, I cannot cmd+click on the Policy. I have to manually search the project for this contract.


[08/30/2022 5:00 PM] illilli000
if you or anyone else figures it out, please let me know, so it can be flagged for future contests


[08/30/2022 5:14 PM] ak19966
did you build the contract ?


[08/30/2022 5:14 PM] ak19966
if the contract built successfully.. it can be navigated


[08/30/2022 5:15 PM] minh___
I am using pycharm with the corresponding solidity plugin, so not sure if its the same cause, but the problem I had are the comment blocks that mark certain regions, like "MODULE INTERFACE" in the pic above. If you comment out **all** the "region titles" in a file, navigating works just fine

[08/30/2022 5:27 PM] devtooligan
that is a v interesting find.  but i think its a PyCharm thing because for me at least, it doesnt seem to fix the problem in vscode


[08/30/2022 5:28 PM] devtooligan
But I do hate those Solmate style section headers.  They also break w code folding


[08/30/2022 5:37 PM] slightscan
Yeah I built the project in shell with `forge build`. It builds successfully. However code navigation doesn't work for all items. For example if I cmd+click on Policy. I think that might be related to the import `import "src/Kernel.sol";` and maybe that there are many contracts in `Kernel.sol` that are not named Kernel.


[08/30/2022 5:38 PM] slightscan
Also clicking on ` OlympusRange internal range;` doesn't work. I thought maybe it's because the file name is different from the contract name.


[08/30/2022 5:38 PM] devtooligan
changing imports to relative imports adds some functionality but doesnt fix the problem completely


[08/30/2022 5:39 PM] slightscan
But if I click `RANGE.price(true, false)`, (on price) then that works ü§î


[08/30/2022 5:39 PM] ak19966
Wat about change into relative paths and the clean and build


[08/30/2022 5:45 PM] slightscan
changing `import "src/Kernel.sol";` to `import "../Kernel.sol";` in `Operator.sol`and clean building didnt seem to help

ok will see what i can do


[08/30/2022 9:38 PM] devtooligan
When this style of section headers is used with code folding, the text of the header (the most important part) disappears.   So you lose your anchors / contextual guides when navigating around a large contract.  This style breaks code folding, and I've seen other types of section headers that can break doc generators.

I'm all for people being creative and I do believe aestethics of a contract are important - especially when we're out here building hyperstructures to last for eternity.

But I don't think it's worth breaking any kind of functionality for aestethics when there are literally limitless alternative styles to choose from.

[08/31/2022 3:57 AM] devtooligan
can you share a little about the reserves.  there is only one operator deployed for the protocol right?  it's not like there's an operator for DAI and an operator for WBTC, etc... from what i saw in the deploy script its DAI?  so does that mean that Olympus keeps most (all) of their reserves in DAI? i'm guessing it would not be common to switch reserve to a different token, right?


[08/31/2022 2:44 PM] oighty
The intent is to initially just run RBS for one reserve against OHM. It will likely be DAI to start with

Can someone please shed lights how transaction queue rules work on blockchain? Does the EVM only run and complete one atomic transaction at a time or does it run multiple function calls concurrently? M-23 says the contract token balance could get a second increment in between previous and current balances. If this is the case, can the same increment be done by having someone sending tokens to the contract in between the two balance updates? Thanks.


[11/05/2022 4:38 AM] neko_nyaa
One atomic tx at a time. 

Are you sure you're looking at the correct issue? M-23 has no mentions about balances


[11/05/2022 3:33 PM] raymondfam
It says/indicates the protocol revenue claimed could happen between balance measurements, incorrectly crediting the attacker's loan repayment. Did I misunderstand it?

External call happens during safeTransferFrom. The assumption is probably a weird ERC20 with a hook.

If that hook can make the treasury claims its revenue or claiming anything that rightfully belongs to the treasury but doesn't belong to msg.sender (e.g. by calling some functions in another non-treasury contract), then both the revenue and _amount are counted towards debt repayment

Would love more of @Czar102 's explanation though

Hey, that is a very accurate description. I am sorry my submission is difficult to interpret üòÖ 
I have no idea how to explain reentrancy issues better, feedback really appreciated


[11/05/2022 5:31 PM] czar102
Note that protocol revenue can only be counted once as a repayment since if one would try to do that twice, that would need to be in between two measurements, which is not possible because of the `ReentrancyGuard`

Wow, thanks much for the clarification. The affected link is also related to M-02 where the safeTransferFrom failed to check token code existence. Other than a self-destructed or an undeployed contract, what else could render a token without a contract in it? And being devoid of code existence, (received == amount_) is still going to return true?

Technically there is `delegatecall` pointing to an empty address. Though the contest note did say the token must be ERC20, so you can't really argue using this.

It won't, but that's the problem. You can do `getLoan()` that accrues debt but you never receive any tokens, and you suddenly have an unrepayable debt.

Thanks for all the detailed replies. I truly learn a lot from this community.
